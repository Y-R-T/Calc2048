# Calc2048 - A Calculus-Enhanced 2048 Game

Calc2048 is a creative adaptation of the classic 2048 game, incorporating calculus and mathematical expressions as gameplay elements. It offers a unique way to explore and visualize mathematical concepts while enjoying a fun puzzle game.

## Features
- **Calculus Tiles**: Perform integrations and differentiations with Calculus Tiles.
- **Exponential Tiles**: Combine exponential terms with fractions and powers.
- **Dynamic Merging**: Merge tiles to create higher-order expressions or perform mixed operations.
- **LaTeX Rendering**: Display mathematical expressions using LaTeX, powered by Matplotlib and Pygame.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to move tiles.
- Tiles of the same type merge to form more complex expressions.
- The game ends when no more moves are possible.
- Reach a certain level of complexity to win!

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame matplotlib numpy
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash

   python calc2048.py
   ```

## Controls
- Arrow keys: Move tiles
- `Q`: Quit the game
